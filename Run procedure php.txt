To run the php code/file written in VSCode
- Put the php code/file in a folder named like "Ecommerce shopping Project"(any name) and full folder in the path:
  C:\xampp\htdocs\Ecommerce Shopping Project
  that is, inside the 'htdocs' of 'xampp folder' in 'C drive' which is created after installing xampp
- Run or Open 'Xampp Application' and start Apache and MySQL
  should be successful running without error
- To see the webpage created by php:
  i. Copy the path by opening the folder "C:\xampp\htdocs\Ecommerce Shopping Project"(copy)
  ii. Open the default browser 'Chrome' and paste the path
  iii. Then from the path write localhost like this:
       "localhost\Ecommerce Shopping Project"
- Your webpage created should be seen. If not, check the Xampp is running without error or not
- If not running properly, there is a port problem

To solve the port problem in Xampp
- By default, port 3306 runs in MySQL
- If it has problem-
  i. Open or Run Xampp Application
  ii. Go to 'config' beside MySQL, inside it -
      a. (# password = your_password 
          port=3309)
          In this line, change the port number to any number like '3309'
      b. (# bind-address="127.0.0.1:3306")
         In this line, change the port like (# bind-address="127.0.0.1:3309")
  iii. Then go to 'Config' of Xampp -> Service and port settings -> MySQL -> 3306 to 3309
  iv. Now go to the path "C:\xampp\phpMyAdmin",that is, phpMyAdmin folder of xampp in C drive
      a. In the phpMyAdmin, a file named "config.inc.php" is there
      b. Click on the file -> Right click -> Open with -> Notepad/ Edit with Notepad++
      c. In the line ($cfg['Servers'][$i]['host'] = '127.0.0.1:3306';), change the port to ($cfg['Servers'][$i]['host'] = '127.0.0.1:3309';)
- Finished
- Run Xampp and start the Apache and MySQL and wait to see if it is running properly

To access the database MySQL -
- Open Xampp Application and start Apache and MySQL
- On the Chrome Browser write ("http://localhost/phpmyadmin/")
 If the Xampp successfully runs, then MySQL will be accessed
